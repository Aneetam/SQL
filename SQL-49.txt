SELECT
  student.full_name,
  count(student_course.course_id) AS no_of_courses
FROM
  student
  LEFT JOIN student_course ON student.id = student_course.student_id
GROUP BY
  student.id;
  
  
  
  
  
  For all the students, get the total number of courses taken by each student.

A student need not register for any course as well. So, we need to perform a left join between thestudentandstudent_coursetables.

Note:
You can get the year from the enrollment date
As we have to calculate the number of courses for each student, we have to GROUP BY the students first and then perform the count() aggregation.
Don't apply ORDER BY, LIMIT, OFFSET clauses as it is not required for this problem.
Expected Output Format:
full_name	no_of_courses
