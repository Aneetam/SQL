SELECT
  student.id AS student_id,

FROM
  student
  LEFT JOIN student_course ON student.id = student_course.student_id
  LEFT JOIN course ON student_course.course_id = course.id
WHERE
  course.name = "Machine Learning"
  AND CAST(strftime("%Y", enrollment_date) AS integer) = 2021;
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  Get all the student details who enrolled for the “Machine Learning” course in the year 2021.

Note:
Here, we have to join student, student_course and course tables.
Apply filters on the combined table.
You can get the year from the enrollment date.
Don't apply ORDER BY, LIMIT, OFFSET clauses as it is not required for this problem.
Expected Output Format:
student_id	full_name	course_id	course_name	enrollment_date
...	...	...
