CREATE TABLE post(
  post_id integer NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,
  content text,
  published_at datetime,
  user_id INT,
  FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES user(id) ON DELETE CASCADE
);





We have created a user table in the database.

Now, let's write a query to represent the post entity type and its relation with user entity type.

Below are the attributes of the post entity type.

attribute	description
post_id	an integer to uniquely identify a post - key attribute
content	a text field
published_at	datetime field
Note:
Create a table in such a way that if we delete a user from the user table, then the related posts in the post table must be automatically deleted.
