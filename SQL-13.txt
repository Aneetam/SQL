  For each player, get the number of matches in which their strike rate is less than 80.0, and the number of matches with strike rate greater than or equal to 80.0.

strike_rate = (score of the player / no_of_balls)*100

Note:

Strike rate should always be a float value.
Output must be in the ascending order of name
