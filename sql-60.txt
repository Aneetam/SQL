  For each post, get the total number of positive reactions and negative reactions aspositive_reactions_countandnegative_reactions_countrespectively.

Note:
Consider the reaction_type "LIKE", "LIT", "WOW" and "LOVE" as positive reactions, and "DISLIKE" as a negative reaction.
If the post does not have positive_reactions, keep the positive_reactions_count as 0.
If the post does not have any negative_reactions, keep the negative_reactions_count as 0.
Sort the output in the ascending order of post_id.
