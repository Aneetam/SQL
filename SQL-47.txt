SELECT
  course.name AS course_name,
  COUNT() AS no_of_students
FROM
  student_course
  INNER JOIN course ON course.id = student_course.course_id
WHERE
  course.name = "Machine Learning"
  AND CAST(strftime("%Y", enrollment_date) AS integer) = 2021
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  Continuation of question 5.
Get the number of students who enrolled for the "Machine Learning" course in 2021.

Note:
Solving this question involves performing inner join oncourseandstudent_coursetables.
You can get the year from the enrollment date.
We have to perform the count() aggregation.
Don't apply ORDER BY, LIMIT, OFFSET clauses as it is not required for this problem.
Expected Output Format:
course_name	no_of_students
...	...
