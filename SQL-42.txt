SELECT
  course.id AS course_id,
  course.name AS course_name,
  instructor.full_name AS instructor_name
FROM
  course NATURAL
  JOIN instructor
WHERE
  instructor.full_name = "Alex";
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  Fetch all the courses that are being taught by “Alex”.

Note:
Solving this problem involves joining ofcoursetable andinstructortable. Note that both the tables haveinstructor_idcolumn in common.
As we only want the courses taught by "Alex", we have to apply filter condition.
Don't apply ORDER BY, LIMIT, OFFSET clauses as it is not required for this problem.
Expected Output Format:
course_id	course_name	instructor_name
...	...	...
