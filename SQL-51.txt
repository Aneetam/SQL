SELECT
  student.id AS student_id,
  student.full_name AS student_name,
  course.id AS course_id,
  course.name AS course_name,
  score,
  enrollment_date
FROM
  student
  LEFT JOIN student_course ON student.id = student_course.student_id
  LEFT JOIN course ON student_course.course_id = course.id;
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  Get all the students details and all the courses for which they have enrolled.

Note:
Here, we have to join student, student_course and course tables.
Performing left join between the student and student_course tables
perform left join on the combined table and course table.
Don't apply ORDER BY, LIMIT, OFFSET clauses as it is not required for this problem.
